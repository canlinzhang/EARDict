# EARDict
The code for the EARDict model described in our paper "Theoretical Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Ending Anchored Rules".

In our code, the grounding set is called self_dict. And the connection set is called regular_dict.

Once downloaded the codes, just put the train, valid and test files of the KG completion task into the same folder and run.
